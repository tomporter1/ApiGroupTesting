```
AS A 
Developer
I NEED TO
Develop a series of test frameworks for JPL's SSD & CNEOS API
SO THAT
I can ensure the API is working 
AND
Its sub-APIs are working
THEN 
Other developers at my company can use the API

### 3 - Sprint And Project Retrospectives<br/><br/>

<br/>

*Information useful to steal for the next project*

‚òÑÔ∏è **Sprint Retrospectives**

###### üå†Sprint 1:<br/>

|Name|What Went Well?|Improvements|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|Getting the initial frameworks set up so we could start working on our own sections|Have set standards and conventions to minimise conflicts in the future|Have set goals for each sprint that are agreed on as a group and refactor any code that can be shared between the different frameworks|
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Setting up the framework quickly and using Github efficiently so the team could quickly get started on their own API test framework. Good use of documentation and project management so we were able to stay focussed|Need to get as much Github practice as possible to stay updated|Need to follow the agreed sprint cards on the project board|
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Worked well as a team. Achieved sprint goal|Time management|In the next sprint I hope to add more tests to the framework|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|Was able to construct the base framework for our test project, minimising future risks by creating separate frameworks for each API. Was then able to run basic Tests against the Sentry API. Utilised branches with each milestone of the project in order to have a well-defined history of progress|Familiarised with how GitHub is integrated within Visual Studio|Continue to work closely with team when merging local branches in order to minimise the risk of errors within the project|

###### üå†Sprint 2:<br/>

|Name|What Went Well?|Improvements|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|Having the framework already set up and working allowed Tom to solely focus on writing tests as the API object model was already set up|Make the API frameworks use shared code modules. This will simplify them and make the easier to use|Add tests to his own framework methods to insure that they work as expected|
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Worked well within the team. Finished all Sprint 2 cards assigned to him. Managed the project board and readme for extensive and useful documentation |Needs to make his code less ugly and hard-coded during Sprint 3|Plans to make his codebase take advantage of the library code more, for future-proofness (lessening possibility of bugs via uselessly different implementations of the same code). Plans to test his own code to ensure it is robust enough |
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Worked well as a team, achieved sprint goal|Minimise conflicts|In the next sprint Thamish hopes to refactor all of his code and prepare the presentation|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|Completed most basic tests for each Sentry API including header responses. Refactored code to future proof his solution. This allowed Sunny to meet requirements set by stakeholders such as separating each type of API into separate projects|Commit more often in order to have more points of recovery within the source control|To test and refactor code further in order to optimise the solutions created. For example only accepting specific inputs within methods to make code more robust|

<br/><br/>


### Projects

| .csproj | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
|***JplApiTesting***|Everything (so far)|

### Class Diagrams

Find class diagrams via [the class diagrams page](ClassDiagrams.md).

### Recommended Visual Studio Extensions

‚òÑÔ∏è ***[CodeMaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SteveCadwallader.CodeMaid)*** ~ Quicker refactoring <br/>
```
Agreed CodeMaid workflow:
1. Click your own folder -> Cleanup Selected Code
2. Do this for both your Service Object Model(s) and test(s)
``` 

[<img src="DocumentationImages/AgrdCodMaiWorkflow.png" alt="meteor image" width="250"/>](DocumentationImages/AgrdCodMaiWorkflow.png) <br/>
‚òÑÔ∏è ***[SideScroller](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drewnoakes.SideScroller)*** ~ Allows horizontal scrolling with ```SHIFT + MOUSEWHEEL```: saves lots of time <br/>
‚òÑÔ∏è ***[Markdown Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor)*** ~ Allows live previewing and syntax highlighting of Github-flavoured markdown (what you're reading right now) <br/>

### Agreed conventions (made only when needed)

<img src="GIFs/Meteor_SouthPark.gif" alt="meteor image" width="250"/> 
<br/><br/>

‚òÑÔ∏è Underscores for private members ```private int _myInt;```<br/>
‚òÑÔ∏è Leave Json classes formatted as they come (except from making arrays into List\<T> ```int[] json_objects``` -> ```List<int> json_objects```) <br/>
‚òÑÔ∏è All git branches should be all lowercase, with underscores ```KieranFireball``` -> ```kieran_fireball```<br/>
‚òÑÔ∏è All tests and test classes should be marked with their author:
<br/>~ **Before** ~
``` C Sharp
public class FireballShould 
{
    [Test]
    public void Contains_ValidString() { ... }
}
``` 
~ **After** ~
```C Sharp
[Author("K McEvaddy")]
public class FireballShould 
{
    [Test]
    [Author("K McEvaddy")]
    public void Contains_ValidString() { ... }
}
``` 
‚òÑÔ∏è Test methods should be named using the [following format (see MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior)](https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming): ```void IsAdult_AgeLessThan18_False()``` <br/>

‚òÑÔ∏è Naming conventions for ```public```, ```private``` and ```protected``` fields: <br/>

|Access modifier|Naming Convention|Case|Underscore?‚¨úÔ∏è‚úÖ|
|---------------|-----------------|----|---------------|
|**public**|```public int MyInt;```|```PascalCase```|‚¨úÔ∏è|
|**protected**|```protected int myInt;```|```camelCase```|‚¨úÔ∏è|
|**private**|```private int _myInt;```|```camelCase```|‚úÖ|
