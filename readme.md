### 3 - Sprint And Project Retrospectives<br/><br/>

<br/>

*Information useful to steal for the next project*

‚òÑÔ∏è **Sprint Retrospectives**

###### üå†Sprint 1:<br/>

|Name|What Went Well?|Improvements|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|Getting the initial frameworks set up so we could start working on our own sections|Have set standards and conventions to minimise conflicts in the future|Have set goals for each sprint that are agreed on as a group and refactor any code that can be shared between the different frameworks|
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Setting up the framework quickly and using Github efficiently so the team could quickly get started on their own API test framework. Good use of documentation and project management so we were able to stay focussed|Need to get as much Github practice as possible to stay updated|Need to follow the agreed sprint cards on the project board|
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Worked well as a team. Achieved sprint goal|Time management|In the next sprint Thamish hopes to add more tests to the framework|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|Was able to construct the base framework for our test project, minimising future risks by creating separate frameworks for each API. Was then able to run basic Tests against the Sentry API. Utilised branches with each milestone of the project in order to have a well-defined history of progress|Familiarised with how GitHub is integrated within Visual Studio|Continue to work closely with team when merging local branches in order to minimise the risk of errors within the project|

###### üå†Sprint 2:<br/>

|Name|What Went Well?|Improvements|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|Having the framework already set up and working allowed Tom to solely focus on writing tests as the API object model was already set up|Make the API frameworks use shared code modules. This will simplify them and make the easier to use|Add tests to his own framework methods to insure that they work as expected|
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Worked well within the team. Finished all Sprint 2 cards assigned to him. Managed the project board and readme for extensive and useful documentation |Needs to make his code less ugly and hard-coded during Sprint 3. Needs to commit more often to source control.|Plans to make his codebase take advantage of the library code more, for future-proofness (lessening possibility of bugs via uselessly different implementations of the same code). Plans to test his own code to ensure it is robust enough |
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Worked well as a team, achieved sprint goal|Minimise conflicts|In the next sprint Thamish hopes to refactor all of his code and prepare the presentation|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|Completed most basic tests for each Sentry API including header responses. Refactored code to future proof his solution. This allowed Sunny to meet requirements set by stakeholders such as separating each type of API into separate projects|Commit more often in order to have more points of recovery within the source control|To test and refactor code further in order to optimise the solutions created. For example only accepting specific inputs within methods to make code more robust|

###### üå†Sprint 3:<br/>

|Name|What Went Well?|Improvements|Action Plan|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|Pull requests and mergers from the dev branch have gone a lot smoother as we have become more familiar with GIT and GitHub. Also splitting up the projects into their own separate projects went surprisingly well as we put considerable effort into minimising conflicts and dependencies at the start of the project|For the different frameworks to use generalised code to simplify them and have them being less hard coded to specific use cases|If this project were to continue past the prototype stage, then it would be good to include more APIs and to generalise the framework more|
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Great documentation: explains the project well.|Wish he had focussed more on the code in this sprint|If the project were to be worked on past the prototype week, Kieran would refine his codebase more and test his own functions more.|
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Worked well as a team<br/>Achieved sprint goal<br/>Refactored code<br/>Achieved stakeholder requirements|Minimise conflicts<br/>Framework needs to use more shared code modules|Test more APIs|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|Was able to test the error responses given for each API when invalid data was given to methods. Implemented tests for specific argument exceptions when sending invalid data given to sentry service methods|Make services more robust when accepting input data, by defining specific exceptions|To refactor the sentry config so that it inherits from a shared parent class between all APIs|


‚òÑÔ∏è **Project Retrospective**

|Name|What have you learned?| What would you do differently next time?| What would you do next?|
|-|-|-|-|
|**(CAD) Tom**|||
|**(Fireball) Kieran**|Extensive documentation<br/>Quickly was able to write Fireball codebase<br/>Learnt a lot about source control<br/>|Could have tested my own code more<br/>Could have tested for exceptions<br/>Could have focussed more on expanding my codebase|If the project were to continue past the prototype stage, Kieran would test more APIs and write tests for more edge cases (negative numbers, overflow etc.)|
|**(Scout) Thamish**|Improved communication and teamwork skills<br>Improved understanding of git and source control|Use more shared code<br/>Manage our time better|Test more Apis<br/>Write more tests for each framework to improve test coverage|
|**(Sentry) Sunny**|During this project Narinder learned how to interact with a source control environment within a team. The daily sprints allowed him to merge often and fully utilise branches to separate features within the project. He then utilised inheritance by extending from base classes to keep code dry. A broad set of tests where created against Sentry API|Implement more error handling of methods created when testing data within API, such as testing against a meteor‚Äôs mass value|Implement what he learned from the previous API‚Äôs to the rest of the available NASA API‚Äôs. Create more base classes in order to reduce duplicated code within different API. Create more tests for the comet over stone hedge with a larger range of API‚Äôs to get a larger set of data|

### Recommended Visual Studio Extensions

‚òÑÔ∏è ***[CodeMaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SteveCadwallader.CodeMaid)*** ~ Quicker refactoring <br/>
```
Agreed CodeMaid workflow:
1. Click your own folder -> Cleanup Selected Code
2. Do this for both your Service Object Model(s) and test(s)
```
